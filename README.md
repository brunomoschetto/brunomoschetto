## Hello 👋  
I'm Bruno, a backend-focused developer specialized in Ruby on Rails, with a solid background in IT infrastructure, cloud environments, and cybersecurity.  
I enjoy building reliable backend systems, collaborating with international teams, and working on products where engineering decisions actually matter.

🌱 Currently deepening my expertise in backend architecture, Rails-based applications, and production-oriented system design, while leveraging my prior experience in infrastructure and security to build robust and scalable solutions.

🤝 I'm looking for backend-oriented opportunities where I can contribute to Ruby on Rails products, collaborate closely with product and frontend teams, and continue growing in complex, real-world systems.
