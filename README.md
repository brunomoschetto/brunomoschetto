![portada_github_bruno](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82727279-d328-462c-a4ee-9584af66ad0b)

I am a professional fullstack web developer and blockchain developer, driven by a passion for innovation and technology. I spent many years working as an IT infrastructure technician, where I honed my problem-solving skills and developed a deep understanding of systems and technology. It was during this time that I discovered my fascination with blockchain technology and its transformative potential.

Motivated to bring ideas to life through code, I transitioned into software development by completing an intensive bootcamp where I mastered Ruby on Rails and other essential tools for modern development. Today, I combine my technical expertise with my interpersonal communication skills and B2B business knowledge to build robust web applications and decentralized solutions.
